# portfolio-website

This is the new home for my portfolio website's source code. I wanted to host it myself, and also perform a couple of invasive maintainence updates.

This is a portfolio website I have been in the process of creating for a long time. With solo projects I have often had trouble with motivation and burnout. I tend to have such a grand vision for what the project will be, work on it obsessively for a week or so, and run out of motivation after getting in way over my head.

## More Ideas

Current Agenda:

- [ ] dockerize and move into a server on google cloud
- [ ] move under the new domain
- [ ] remove react router and actually find a static server to host it
- [ ] move from cra to vite
- [ ] set up forwarding from the github domain to the new one
- [ ] hook up static site generator to
- [ ] join the stevens webring
- [ ] hook up an email to my domain
- [ ] spline 3d visuals for big project backer

Future Roadmap:

- dynamic layout for #abouthim, which accomadates different sizes of pictures
- mobile view, proper scaling for #abouthim, font scaling
- more hover effects, optimization of parallax
- use spline & webflow to make 3d model background for project images
- hovering over hoboken and nashua show maps
- SEO and web indexing stuff
- move to aws and get custom domain name (? probably not, but we will see...)
